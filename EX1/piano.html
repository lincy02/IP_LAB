        <p>The piano is a stringed keyboard instrument in which the strings are struck by wooden hammers that are coated with a softer material.
		It is played using a keyboard, which is a row of keys that the performer presses down or strikes with the fingers and thumbs of
		both hands to cause the hammers to strike the strings.</p>
